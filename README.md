# Lineup

## Installation

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp
node server.js
```

then open up localhost:8080

### Notes: 

text box doesn’t really work, but linking does. if you click the ‘ayy’ button it should go to /event/10 which should show the event id as 10. so you can use this to do routing.

## Workflow:
Make changes in the src folder, and gulp will build them into the dist folder which have the files that are actually served. 

## Relevant Files: 

`src/js/main.js` — has routing code and imports both the home and event page 

`src/js/components/app.js` — useless, ignore

`src/js/HomePage.js` — has the code for the home page

`src/js/EventPage.js` — has the code for the event page

`src/index.html` — the html file which will include the compiled script generated by gulp 

`src/public/` — put images and shit here and they can be accessed by putting them in HTML i.e. `<img src=‘/public/image-name.jpg’ /> `

nothing else is relevant 

### NOTE ON GULP:
- make changes only in the src folder
- if you make a change to anything in src, run ‘gulp’ and refresh your browser to see the changes
- if you’re repeatedly making changes to js files in src, you can run ‘gulp watch’ to have gulp rebuild files when they are changed. NOTE: you must have run ‘gulp’ once before because gulp watch only tracks change after you call it. NOTE2: DON’T ADD/REMOVE FILES WHILE GULP WATCH IS RUNNING…(still gotta fix the gulpfile to allow for this).
